# Proofcast Architecture

## Overview

Proofcast is designed as a modular system for creating verifiable causality chains in distributed systems. The architecture follows a layered approach to ensure separation of concerns and flexibility.

## Core Components

1. **Proof Generation Layer**
   - Responsible for creating cryptographic proofs of system states and transitions
   - Implements zero-knowledge proof algorithms to maintain privacy while ensuring verifiability
   - Interfaces with the underlying systems to extract relevant state information

2. **Verification Layer**
   - Provides mechanisms to verify the cryptographic proofs
   - Exposes APIs for third-party verification
   - Implements batch verification for performance optimization

3. **Policy Engine**
   - Enforces rules about what constitutes valid causality chains
   - Configurable through policy definitions in YAML
   - Provides plugin architecture for custom policy implementations

4. **Storage Layer**
   - Persists proofs and verification results
   - Implements tamper-evident storage mechanisms
   - Provides efficient query capabilities for historical verification
