# Proofcast

**Dynamically verifiable infrastructure for documented causality.**  
No promises. Just receipts.

## 🧩 What is Proofcast?

`Proofcast` is a stack for generating, signing, and publishing cryptographically verifiable receipts of digital actions — DNS lookups, API calls, policy triggers.

Each action yields a receipt.  
Each receipt links to a cause.  
Each cause maps to a declared policy.
